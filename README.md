Ip finding code is used to filter traffic using Machine Learning algorithms.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
Must have Python 3.11.x version.
You must install the following dependencies.
 - Pandas : pip install pandas
 - sklearn : pip install scikit-learn
 - matplotlib : pip install matplotlib
 - seaborn: pip install seaborn
 - NumPy: pip install numpy

Once you have all the required dependencies, you can find the code in this repository and run your environment.

I used a VS code to run this, where I installed the Python and Jupiter Notebook extensions.

**NOTE:**
While running the code, please make sure you are changing the paths of datasets according to where you keep that file.

**DATASETS:**

We have also attached datasets in this repository, which we have used. 
But you can generate your dataset as well. The dataset is just a collection of the packets from Wireshark. You can start the Wireshark and capture the packets. After that, convert that .pcap file to a .csv file.

**ALGORITHMS:**

    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - SVM
    - KNN: KNeighbors
    - Naive Bayes
    
We have used these ML algorithms to compare our results and see the accuracy.
These are prebuilt in Python. We need to import libraries and use them.
We just need to train and test the model.
